# Argumentation-mining
The scope of this assignment was to initially to manually assess and mark the structure and argument components of multiple abstracts and upon consolidation of the results, to create a machine learning model in the context of argumentation mining from multiple abstracts provided. Also, we tried to create clusters from the documents based on their content and some other features such as project objective.

The baseline model.ipynb contains the code of  basic model which created for comparison purposes with FastText approach.

The FastText model.ipynb contains the code of the FastText model regarding the argument labels.

The FastText model-structure.ipynb contains the code of the FastText model regarding the structure labels.

The Clustering.ipynb contains the code regarding the clustering procedure using document, project obejective and claim embeddings.

Also, we uploaded a report.docx.
